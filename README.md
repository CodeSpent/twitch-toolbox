<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This tool is inspired by recent Twitch DMCA issues that have forced the hands of many to delete their clips to prevent any possibility of a ban. These are memories currated over the years, 
but manually downloading years worth of clips is just not viable. So I built the first feature of this manager which allows you to download all of your clips from Twitch before deleting!

This project is currently in very early stages of development, and I had to rush development a bit for the users who requested it, so bare with me, and feel free to report any issues or feature requests.
